This was the first year that the salon</tspan><tspan x="0" y="173">awards were selected by a panel of judges. Bill Westwood conceived the idea and Don</tspan><tspan x="0" y="199">Biggerstaff implemented the process. Karen Waldo, David Mascaro and Roger Postem, PhD</tspan><tspan x="0" y="225">designed the criteria by which the work would be judged. Six judges used a simple judging form</tspan><tspan x="0" y="251">and entries were judged as they were lined up on the floor around the room. A new set of</tspan><tspan x="0" y="277">student categories was set up because it was felt that the student work should not have to</tspan><tspan x="0" y="303">compete with the professional categories. Awards were given at the Awards Banquet.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="329"></tspan></tspan><tspan x="0" y="355">1980 Savannah, GA:</tspan><tspan y="355" xml:space="preserve" font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400"> The number of judges was increased to thirteen (six for professional,</tspan><tspan font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400"><tspan x="0" y="381">seven for student) to speed up the judging process. The 1979 judging forms were used and all</tspan><tspan x="0" y="407">judges judged every entry.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="433"></tspan></tspan><tspan x="0" y="459">1981 Toronto, Ontario: </tspan><tspan y="459" font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400">The editorial category was added this year. The nine member judging</tspan><tspan font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400"><tspan x="0" y="485">panel included two doctors. It was felt that inclusion of an anatomist and a surgeon would help</tspan><tspan x="0" y="511">eliminate medical errors. This worked fairly well, except that the two doctors did not always</tspan><tspan x="0" y="537">agree on the &quot;correct&quot; anatomy. The 1979 judging forms were used and all judges judged every</tspan><tspan x="0" y="563">entry before it was hung.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="589"></tspan></tspan><tspan x="0" y="615">1982 Anaheim, CA: </tspan><tspan y="615" font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400">The six member judging panel included two commercial illustrators and an</tspan><tspan font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400"><tspan x="0" y="641">art director from outside the profession. The group of six judged both the professional and</tspan><tspan x="0" y="667">student categories. The work was judged in elimination rounds. Round one: all entries were</tspan><tspan x="0" y="693">viewed in 35mm slide format. Round two: judges sat in semi-circle and viewed the remaining</tspan><tspan x="0" y="719">original entries one at a time as they were presented by a student. (The 1979 judging forms</tspan><tspan x="0" y="745">were used once again) Round three: final choices were made for first, second and honorable</tspan><tspan x="0" y="771">mention.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="797">This was the year that many first and second place ribbons were not awarded. The reason</tspan><tspan x="0" y="823">given is that the members of the judging panel from the commercial community felt that</tspan><tspan x="0" y="849">draftsmanship of entries in some categories did not meet some arbitrary imaginary standard.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="875">AMI member reaction was not positive, prompting the Board of Governors to require that future</tspan><tspan x="0" y="901">salon judges be Professional members of the AMI.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="927"></tspan></tspan><tspan x="0" y="953">1983 Chicago, IL:</tspan><tspan y="953" xml:space="preserve" font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400"> The cartooning category was added. The eight member panel was divided</tspan><tspan font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400"><tspan x="0" y="979">into a professional and student section. Judging proceeded exactly as in 1982, except that the</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1005">judges chose not to utilize the judging forms, claiming that they were too time consuming. Note:</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1031">This was the year that the Salon Committee and judges could not get access to the Salon room</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1057">until the morning of the Salon opening. This only gave the judges nine hours to judge and hang</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1083">the Salon. (This process usually took 24 hours.) AMI purchased Gaterfoam panels this year.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1109"></tspan></tspan><tspan x="0" y="1135">1984 Atlanta, GA: </tspan><tspan y="1135" font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400">Entry fees were instituted this year. The eleven member panel (six</tspan><tspan font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400"><tspan x="0" y="1161">professional category, five student category) decided not to judge the artwork in slide form, but</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1187">rather to use the original art for all phases of judging. Each piece of artwork was judged by all</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1213">panelists using the judging form. The top four scores in each category were then reviewed for</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1239">final placement ranking. The main drawback this year was that using the forms on every entry</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1265">was so time consuming that the judges worked almost around the clock to complete their jobs</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1291">before the Salon opening.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1317"></tspan></tspan><tspan x="0" y="1343">1985 Cincinnati, OH:</tspan><tspan y="1343" xml:space="preserve" font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400"> Two new categories were added this year, computer generated art and</tspan><tspan font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400"><tspan x="0" y="1369">medical/legal art. The thirteen member panel used the judging forms to score the artwork in the</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1395">first several categories, then discarded the forms part way through the process as time became</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1421">short. At this time, scores were given to the remaining pieces of artwork in a subjective manner.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1447">Once the scores were given, the numbers were tabulated and the winners chosen strictly by the</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1473">highest scores. Even the judges did not know who the winners were until the night of the Salon</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1499">opening. Note: One other problem occurred this year. Three very outspoken members of the</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1525">judging panel tended to intimidate other judges by voicing strong opinions on minor anatomy</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1551">and stylistic problems. Because the judging occurred in one large group, some members felt</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1577">compelled to go along with the group even though their own opinions differed on the work.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1603"></tspan></tspan><tspan x="0" y="1629">1986 Norfolk, VA: </tspan><tspan y="1629" font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400">This nine member panel (seven professional category, three student</tspan><tspan font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400"><tspan x="0" y="1655">category) used new, improved judging forms this year. The new forms were divided by category,</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1681">set up to be read more easily and the point spreads were expanded to help eliminate close point</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1707">totals between entries. An anatomist was included on this year&apos;s panel. He was very helpful in</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1733">the straight anatomy but eliminated many surgical anatomy pieces in which anatomy was</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1759">represented in a non-traditional manner.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1785">At the Interim Board Meeting after this year&apos;s Annual Meeting, the Board members directed the</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1811">Salon Chair, for all future meetings, to try to have AMI members serve as judges only twice</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1837">within a ten year period and not to serve for two years in a row. The rationale for this was that</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1863">there are between 600 and 700 members in the Association and some members were being</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1889">asked to serve as judges year after year. The Board felt that &quot;new blood&quot; would help the</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1915">fairness of the judging process.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="1941"></tspan></tspan><tspan x="0" y="1967">1987 Minneapolis, MN: </tspan><tspan y="1967" font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400">Many changes were instituted this year in response to membership and</tspan><tspan font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400"><tspan x="0" y="1993">judges complaints regarding the judging process. Under the new procedures, the time pressure</tspan><tspan x="0" y="2019">on the judges was reduced by splitting the judges up into four mini-panels of three to four</tspan><tspan x="0" y="2045">judges. Now, instead of all members of the larger judging panels judging every category of</tspan><tspan x="0" y="2071">artwork in the Salon (the old time-consuming process), the new mini-panels are only</tspan><tspan x="0" y="2097">responsible for judging three or four categories. Judges on the mini-panels are selected so that</tspan><tspan x="0" y="2123">their expertise closely matches the categories which they are judging. This allows the judges to</tspan><tspan x="0" y="2149">take more time evaluating each entry and helps insure that the judging process is consistent</tspan><tspan x="0" y="2175">throughout.</tspan><tspan x="0" y="2201"></tspan></tspan><tspan x="0" y="2227">1989 Dallas, TX: </tspan><tspan y="2227" font-family="Raleway-Regular, Raleway" font-weight="400">The Salon was once again judged in mini-panels.
